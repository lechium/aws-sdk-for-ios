This fork solely exists to make it easier to build this project without having to set up your own xcodeproj.

I make the minor tweaks necessary to get it to build (the build errors for missing files can be fixed simply by making a copy of AmazonServiceRequest.h and putting it in the src folder's root path.

i also added a Run Script target that /should/ create the necessary framework folder layout and open it for you when complete.

enjoy!
